    "1- What is a RESTful API?\n",
    "Ans:- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of web API that follows the principles of REST architecture, \n",
    "which is a set of guidelines for creating scalable and stateless web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of RESTful APIs: Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the \n",
    "request. The server doesn't store client context between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources: Everything in a RESTful API is treated as a resource (e.g., users, posts, products) and is accessed using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), \n",
    "like:\n",
    "HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET ‚Äì Retrieve data (e.g., GET /users)\n",
    "\n",
    "POST ‚Äì Create a new resource (e.g., POST /users)\n",
    "\n",
    "PUT ‚Äì Update an existing resource (e.g., PUT /users/123)\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE ‚Äì Remove a resource (e.g., DELETE /users/123)\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (or XML) Format: Data is typically exchanged in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), although XML is also supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stateless Communication: Each API call is independent; the server does not retain client session data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Interface: REST enforces a consistent interface, making it easier to use and understand across different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you're building an API for a book store.\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /books ‚Äì List all books\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /books/1 ‚Äì Get details of book with ID 1\n",

    "HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Response body (with data types, structure, and possible examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication/Authorization: Specifies how clients should authenticate (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Formats: Usually JSON or XML. The spec defines the schema of inputs/outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: Defines how errors are communicated, with codes and message formats.\n",

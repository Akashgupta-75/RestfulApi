    "1- What is a RESTful API?\n",
    "Ans:- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of web API that follows the principles of REST architecture, \n",
    "which is a set of guidelines for creating scalable and stateless web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of RESTful APIs: Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the \n",
    "request. The server doesn't store client context between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources: Everything in a RESTful API is treated as a resource (e.g., users, posts, products) and is accessed using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), \n",
    "like:\n",
    "HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET – Retrieve data (e.g., GET /users)\n",
    "\n",
    "POST – Create a new resource (e.g., POST /users)\n",
    "\n",
    "PUT – Update an existing resource (e.g., PUT /users/123)\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE – Remove a resource (e.g., DELETE /users/123)\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (or XML) Format: Data is typically exchanged in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), although XML is also supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stateless Communication: Each API call is independent; the server does not retain client session data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Interface: REST enforces a consistent interface, making it easier to use and understand across different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you're building an API for a book store.\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /books – List all books\n",
    "\n",
    "GET /books/1 – Get details of book with ID 1\n",
    "\n",
    "POST /books – Add a new book\n",
    "\n",
    "PUT /books/1 – Update book with ID 1\n",

    "2-Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
    "Ans:- An API specification is a formal, structured document that defines how an API behaves and how developers can interact with it. It serves as a blueprint for both the API’s implementation and its consumption by client applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 Key Aspects of an API Specification: Endpoints: The URLs through which resources are accessed (e.g., /users, /orders/{id}).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Methods: Defines which HTTP verbs are allowed for each endpoint (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",

    "Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "Query parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Request body (with data types and required fields)\n",

    "Response Structure: Describes what the server will return:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Response body (with data types, structure, and possible examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication/Authorization: Specifies how clients should authenticate (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Formats: Usually JSON or XML. The spec defines the schema of inputs/outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: Defines how errors are communicated, with codes and message formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Why API Specifications Matter: Consistency: Ensures different teams understand and implement the API the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation: Enables tools to generate client libraries, documentation, and server stubs automatically.\n",
